issue.
* If you have used `pip` to install the package, please indicate the version that you are using.
* Did I say details are very important?

# Feature requests

It could be always possible to add new features and I would be very happy if you could directly contribute new features
by coding it instead of asking me to implement them :)

# Pull requests

Please use `devmaster` branch for creating PRs.

# Tests

The project includes tests under `'tests/` directory and all tests are designed to run with `pytest`.
I would be glad if you could follow this notation if you are planning to contribute to tests.
