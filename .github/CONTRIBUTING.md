# Contribution Guidelines

First of all, I am really glad you are here and I hope you liked NURBS-Python. I appreciate your time and efforts on
testing and debugging NURBS-Python. Before you post, I would like to recommend some resources for starters:

* [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* [README file](../README.rst)
* [Official Documentation](http://nurbs-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [The NURBS Book](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642973857)

## Before you post, please read!

It would be good to remember these before you post to the issue tracker or email the author:

* Remember that you are talking to humans
* Adhere to the same standards of behavior that you follow in your real life as you are talking to complete strangers
* Please be kind and respectful in your posts
* Please and please don't use stingy words or phrases
* Double-check your attitude in your posts
* Be reasonable
* Simply, __be nice__!

The following will **NOT** be tolerated in any way:

* Any sort of offensive comment
* Contempt and/or disdain in explicit and/or implicit ways
* Accusation directed to the authors and/or contributors (that's why we have the LICENSE file, check it out)
* Implication of you having the IQ of [INT_MAX](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/climits/) and all others can only
have the ability to breathe
* Implication of you having the ability to travel to Mars in less than 1 microseconds
* A strange thought that people who read the issue tracker have ability to read your mind
* Anything that makes you feel discomfort when it is done 2 times harder to you in person
* ... and other similar stuff

I really don't like to indicate these details in a public post but all authors and contributors spend their free time
to put some effort on development of this package. Their free time is as valuable as your free time, the time you spend
outside of your regular work doing non-work and completely unrelated things.
Nobody has to tolerate to you in any way, if you don't care about what you write.
In case of any confusions or problems, please follow [this link](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=netiquette).

## What happens when you found a bug

* Please read __Before You Post__ rules (right above)
* Please make sure that you are using the latest version on the `master` branch.
* Please try to explain the problem as much as possible. I would be glad if you could write the steps to reproduce the
issue.
* If you have used `pip` to install the package, please indicate the version that you are using.
* Did I say details are very important?

**Note:** There will be no bug fixes and updates to `v2.x` branch.

## Feature requests

It could be always possible to add new features and the same rules are effective as if you have found a bug.
**I would be very much glad if you could directly develop the new features and make a pull request
instead of asking me to implement them** :)

## Pull requests

Please use `devmaster` branch for creating PRs.

## Tests

The project includes tests under `'tests/` directory and all tests are designed to run with `pytest`.
I would be glad if you could follow this notation if you are planning to contribute to tests.

NURBS-Python is a free and open-source project. The author and all contributors volunteered their free time to develop
