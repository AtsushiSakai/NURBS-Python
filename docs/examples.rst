Example Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please check the `Examples <https://github.com/orbingol/NURBS-Python_Examples>`_ repository on how to use this library.
I only provide some scripts in this repository. If you are an avid user of `Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`_, I believe
that it would be very easy to convert these scripts into Jupyter notebooks.
