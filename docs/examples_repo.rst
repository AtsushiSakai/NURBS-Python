Examples Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using NURBS-Python is very easy: set degrees, control points and knot vectors, and you are all good. To give you a
head-start on working with NURBS-Python, the authors also provide an Examples_ repository describing some basic usage of
the library and its modules.

The Examples_ repository contains examples on the following:

* Bézier curves and surfaces
* BSplines & NURBS curves
* B-Spline and NURBS surfaces
* Control points grid generation for ``Surface`` classes
* Automatic knot vector generation for curves and surfaces
* Visualization
* Automatic NURBS curve and surface generation
* Curve & surface splitting and Bézier decomposition
