NURBS-Python Documentation
==========================

|DOI|_

Welcome to NURBS-Python documentation! NURBS-Python is a Python library containing Python implementations of several
`The NURBS Book <http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642973857>`_ algorithms. These algorithms are used for generating
Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) 2D/3D curves and surfaces.

NURBS-Python also provides a convenient and easy-to-use data structure for storing curve and surface descriptions. All
elements of the provided data structures are documented under :ref:`modules`.

This documentation is organized into a couple sections:

* :ref:`introduction`
* :ref:`examples`
* :ref:`modules`
