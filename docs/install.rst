Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using Pip
=========

You can find the NURBS-Python library on `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/geomdl>`_ and install
using the following command:

``pip install geomdl``

Manual Method
=============

Included *setup.py* script will take care of the installation and automatically copy the required files to
*site-packages* directory. Please run the following from the command line:

``python setup.py install``

If you don't want to put the files into your Python distribution's *site-packages* directory for some reason (e.g.
extension development or bug fixing), you can run

``python setup.py develop``

from the command line to generate a link to the package directory inside *site-packages*.
