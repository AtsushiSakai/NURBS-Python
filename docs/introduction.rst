Motivation
^^^^^^^^^^

NURBS-Python is an object-oriented Python library containing implementations of :doc:`NURBS <q_a>` 2D/3D curve and
surface generation and evaluation algorithms. It also provides a convenient and easy-to-use data structure for storing
curve and surface descriptions as Python properties.

Some of the significant features of the NURBS-Python Library are:

* Python 2.x and 3.x compatibility
* No external dependencies (such as NumPy)
* Implements Python properties (using *property* decorator)
* A :code:`utilities` module containing several helper functions
* :code:`Grid` and :code:`GridWeighted` classes for generating various types of control points grids
