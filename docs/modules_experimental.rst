Experimental Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NURBS-Python comes with several optional modules. These modules might require installation of additional packages,
might come with extra requirements or their API might change between NURBS-Python releases. Therefore, even though
they are distributed with the package, due to these reasons they are considered as experimental. However, they are
mature enough to be used in production environments.

Generating Common Shapes
========================

NURBS-Python provides an experimental module for automatic generation of the most commonly used curves and surfaces.
