Package Name
^^^^^^^^^^^^

NURBS-Python uses ``geomdl`` as the package name which is the shortened version of *geometric modeling*.

Prior to version 3.x series, the package name was ``nurbs``. However, using a generic name like that might seem to
cause conflicts with other packages, and therefore in version 3.x of the library, it is renamed to ``geomdl``.
