Using the Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using NURBS-Python is very easy: set degrees, control points and knot vectors, and you are all good. In case you might
have some toruble in using the library, there exists an Examples_ repository which is meant to give you a head-start on
using the library and its modules.

The Examples_ repository contains examples on the following:

* Bézier surfaces and 2D/3D curves
* 2D/3D BSpline & NURBS curve generation
* Surface generation
* Control points grid generation for ``Surface`` classes
* Automatic knot vector generation for curves and surfacee
* Visualization
* Automatic NURBS curve and surface generation
* Curve & surface splitting and Bézier decomposition
